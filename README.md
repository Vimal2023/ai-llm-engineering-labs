# 🚀 AI & LLM Engineering Labs (Hands-on)

This repository contains **hands-on implementations** of modern AI engineering concepts including **Python fundamentals, Large Language Models (LLMs), Agentic AI, RAG pipelines, LangChain, LangGraph, Vector Databases, and scalable AI systems**.

All code is written by practicing concepts learned in a **full-stack Generative & Agentic AI bootcamp**, focusing on **real-world, production-style implementations** rather than theory.
